## Target Group
Our game is designed primarily for university students, with a focus on computer science students. This demographic is familiar with gaming and can benefit from an engaging way to learn complex subjects like logic circuits.

## Instructional Design

### Description of Game

#### General Overview
Tu/echnical Factory is a factory-building game where players start in an empty area with the goal of developing a factory to produce a computer within a given time. The game involves mining resources, building machines, and configuring logic circuits to advance production.

#### Machines and Recipes
- **Machines:**
  - Miner: Gathers raw resources.
  - Smeltry: Transforms ores into bars.
  - Crafting Machine: Crafts advanced materials from base materials.
- **Storage:**
  - Storage Container: Stores produced materials.
- **Additional Tools:**
  - Splitter: Divides conveyor belts.
  - Merger: Merges conveyor belts.
- **Recipes:**
  - Various combinations of ores and bars to create complex materials like computer chassis and CPUs.

### Learning Goals
- Solve logic gate problems within a time limit.
- Transform logic gates into logical formulas.
- Develop cognitive skills that benefit engineering problems.

## Persuasive Design
The game leverages several motivational theories to enhance engagement:
- **Self-Determination Theory:** Time constraints and clear goals increase motivation.
- **Active Processing:** Players actively solve logical expressions, enhancing retention.
- **Sense of Risk and Uncertainty:** Limited attempts to solve puzzles create engagement.
- **Self-Efficacy Theory:** Mastery and progression enhance players' confidence.
- **Flow Theory:** Balanced challenges keep players immersed in the game.

## Design Process

### Elaborating on the Problem
Understanding the need for an educational yet enjoyable game, we focused on creating a game that incorporates theories covered in our coursework.

### Gathering Information
We researched game engines and settled on Unity due to its familiarity and suitability for our project.

### Analysis and Planning
We designed the game mechanics to motivate players through challenges, tying logic circuits to machine activation within the game.

### Execution
Our development process was divided into mechanics, assets, and programming, ensuring efficient and focused progress.

### Feedback and Reflection
We gathered feedback from testers and made necessary improvements, such as clearer instructions and enhancing the logic circuit system.
